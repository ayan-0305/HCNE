# HCNE
A Hierarchical Clustering Approach for Network Embedding

The 'model' folder contains the codebase for generating the HCNE embedding vectors for nodes in an input graph.

The 'Evaluation' folder contains the code for evaluating generated embedding vectors on different downstream prediction tasks as well as generating a sampled graph representative of the original graph.
